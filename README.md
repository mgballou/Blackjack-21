# Blackjack - 21 by Matthew Ballou

## Intro:

I built this game in the browser as my Project 1 during General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive. This project was focused on general web development fundamentals in JavaScript.

Blackjack is generally played with one to eight decks of 52 cards. My game uses a deck of 104 cards, reshuffling the full deck any time the player reaches a game over. 

You start the game with $1000 and can continue winning as long as you still have money.
